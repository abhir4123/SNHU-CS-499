        <div class="sa-body">
          <p>The artifact I chose for this enhancement is the AppointmentService component from my CS-320 Software Testing and Quality Assurance course project. The original version was a Java-based backend service, created in early 2025 that handled basic CRUD operations for appointment records using in-memory storage. It also included JUnit tests but had no user interface and no structure for scaling into a larger application. I originally created it to practice object-oriented programming and test-driven development.</p>
          <p>I selected this artifact because it gave me a strong starting point to show how my skills in software engineering and design have grown. While the original met the basic requirements, it was missing features that are expected in professional applications, such as a scalable architecture, persistent storage, and a user-friendly interface. In this enhancement, I redesigned it as a full-stack web application. I built a RESTful backend with Spring Boot, created a React frontend for user interaction, and used best practices like separation of concerns and clear API endpoint design. These updates demonstrate skills in both frontend and backend development, REST API creation, and form validation on both the client and server sides. The responsive interface, combined with real-time communication between the frontend and backend, shows my ability to create complete, production-style applications.</p>
          <p>In my Module One enhancement plan, I targeted Course Outcomes 3 and 4, and I believe this enhancement successfully meets all of them, along with Outcome 2 as well. Outcome 2 was met by creating a detailed, user-friendly README and adding clear code comments throughout the project, ensuring technical communication that is coherent and suited to a developer audience. For Outcome 3, I applied algorithmic principles and industry practices to restructure the code into a modular, decoupled system. I also made design choices with scalability in mind, such as keeping the current in-memory storage but preparing the backend so it can easily be connected to a database. For Outcome 4, I used modern tools and techniques such as Spring Boot for backend development, React for the frontend, and REST API design principles to create a functional and valuable application. My original outcome coverage plan remains the same because the finished project meets the goals I set.</p>
          <p>The enhancement process required rethinking the application’s architecture and building connections between a backend service and a modern frontend framework. I learned how to set up RESTful communication, handle CORS configurations, and use both server-side and client-side validation to improve user experience. One of the biggest challenges was keeping the frontend and backend separate but fully in sync. I had to troubleshoot issues with request formats, JSON serialization, and displaying meaningful error messages to users. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of full-stack workflows, REST API design, and how to improve usability through better error handling and form validation. Overall, this enhancement transformed a small backend service into a complete web application and strengthened my ability to design and deliver software that meets real-world standards.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Enhanced Artifact: Algorithms and Data Structure</h2>
      <p>
        For this enhancement, I focused on retrieval performance and deterministic ordering by introducing a secondary index:
        <span class="mono">private final NavigableMap&lt;LocalDate, List&lt;Appointment&gt;&gt; byDate = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();</span>
        This complements the HashMap for O(1) ID lookups and supports efficient chronological queries. I also refined validation,
        ensured ordered endpoint responses, and added CSV and JSON export support in the frontend.

        <div class="sa-body">
          <p>The artifact I chose for this enhancement is the AppointmentService component from my CS-320 Software Testing and Quality Assurance course project. The original version was a Java-based backend service that handled basic CRUD operations for appointment records using in-memory storage. This artifact was first created in early 2025, and for this enhancement, I focused on improving its data handling efficiency and retrieval accuracy by redesigning its algorithms and data structures. Since I am using the same artifact to enhance for all three of the project categories, the enhancements made for this milestone partially build on the enhancements made in the last milestone.</p>
          <p>I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and implement efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms, which are important skills for any software engineer. This enhancement introduced a secondary data structure, a TreeMap&lt;LocalDate, List&lt;Appointment&gt;&gt;, alongside the existing HashMap&lt;String, Appointment&gt;. This change allows for deterministic ordering of appointments by date, allowing for efficient separation of “upcoming” and “previous” appointments. By integrating multiple data structures and optimizing retrieval algorithms, the artifact showcases my understanding of both hash-based and tree-based structures, as well as how to select the appropriate structure for a given use case. In addition to the new data structure, I implemented logic to ensure deterministic ordering in endpoint responses, refined validation rules, and added functionality to export appointment data in CSV and JSON formats. These improvements make the service more robust, scalable, and adaptable for real-world use cases.</p>
          <p>In Module One, I planned to meet Outcome 3 and Outcome 4. With these enhancements, I achieved those outcomes and also met Outcome 1 and Outcome 2. For Outcome 3, I designed and implemented a dual-index approach that balances constant-time ID access with logarithmic-time sorted queries, which supports both high performance and flexibility. For Outcome 4, I applied industry-relevant tools and techniques by using Spring Boot to provide well-structured REST endpoints for retrieving all, upcoming, previous, and ranged appointments, as well as for exporting the data. For Outcome 1, the CSV and JSON export feature supports collaborative decision-making by allowing administrators, staff, and clients to work with the same structured data in formats they can use. For Outcome 2, I improved the clarity and professionalism of the project through clear code comments, informative error messages, and an expanded README that explains how to set up, use, and test the application.</p>
          <p>This enhancement reinforced the importance of selecting the right data structures to improve both the functionality and performance of a system. Keeping the hash map and tree map synchronized required careful attention to update and delete logic to ensure data consistency. Implementing deterministic ordering for upcoming and previous appointment queries improved both the usability of the API and the predictability of results for the frontend. The addition of export functionality encouraged me to think about how the service could support collaboration beyond the UI, making the data more accessible for different audiences. Improving validation, error messages, and documentation also strengthened my ability to communicate technical behavior clearly, which is a critical skill for working on software projects that will be maintained or extended by others.</p>
